Map of Life has released a new species mapper. It provides all spatial data available for a species in the Map of Life, arranged by type and source, in a single interactive dashboard and map. Filter point observations by year and spatial uncertainty (large for old records with little documentation or surveys covering large areas, small for those new GPS contributions). Interrogate individual records and their sources by clicking on the map. Explore how different kinds of data tell different stories about species distributions. In the example of the Copper sunbird shown below, points, expert maps, and survey data all would result in very different assessments of the speciesâ€™ range and environmental associations.  [Explore the map interface for this species](http://species.mol.org/species/map/Nectarinia_cuprea), and check back as we add more facets, filters and tools to this map interface.
