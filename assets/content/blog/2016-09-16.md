With sponsorship from Map of Life IUCN Nepal has received a PEER grant from the US National Academy to collaborate on 
new web-based tools to support conservationists, researchers, and local communities in the region.


Driven by demand for a consolidated, open source, and scaleable platform - JaibikMap - IUCN Nepal, with the help of 
Map of Life have partnered together to make vital information accessible to multiple stakeholders. This is part of an 
on-going effort to improve biodiversity outcomes, obtain up-to-date data, and engage the public. JaibikMap will 
leverage the power of Map of Life to visualize species range maps, develop upload tools, map species richness, and 
compare and predict future scenarios.
