Putting biodiversity in the palm of your hand just got easier. While there are many mobile apps that are either designed to help locate, identify, or report plants and wildlife, virtually all of them require an internet connection. Map of Life leads the pack in enabling all of these features while being used in remote areas, allowing you to leave your heavy guide books at home. Visitors to Denali National Park can pre-download species lists and park information before entering the park and even submit observations while offline!

Denali National Park is located in a rugged, remote part of the world, where visitors can count on not having network access while within the park. The park depends on its citizen science program to track wildlife occurrences and movements, which is driven by visitors reporting where and when they spot species. Map of Life has teamed up with Denali National Park to help educate visitors, as well as streamline the citizen science data collection process.

In Version 2.0 of the mobile app, users can download lists of species before headed into Denali National Park. While offline, visitors will have access to species lists and park information. Visitors can also report sightings while offline, and these records will be updated to the user’s dashboard once internet connection is re-established. Update to version 2.0 and tap on ‘Offline areas’ to get started!

We hope you enjoy the new features and stay tuned while we add more regions for download. Don’t forget to share with your friends and family, and leave us a review in the App Store.
