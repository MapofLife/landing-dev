We are excited to announce a new feature to our website! It is now possible to explore the biodiversity in and around a 
selected region. Users can search for a region and explore which species occur in that area. Regions currently 
available for exploration include countries as well as states/provinces/territories for larger countries such as the 
United States, Canada, Australia, and India.

The detailed map further allows users to view what type of data is available in that region for a given species. 
For example, the [Rufous-eyed Brook Frog](https://mol.org/species/map/Duellmanohyla_rufioculis?region=costa+rica), 
*Duellmanohyla rufioculis*, is an amphibian that is found in Costa Rica.
